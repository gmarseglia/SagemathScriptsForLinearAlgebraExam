Run 'sage' from terminal.

Once sage is loaded and interactive:
	1. load('script.sage')
		Loads the script and execute it once.
	
	2. attach('script.sage')
		Loads the script and execute it every time script.sage changes, perfect for debug.

CTRL+D or 'exit' to end the Sage session and go back to terminal.
